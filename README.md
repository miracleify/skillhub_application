Hey team,

Just a quick update — the SkillHub Application has now been fully dockerized and set up with a scalable CI/CD deployment pipeline.

Repo: https://github.com/miracleify/skillhub_application
Live Preview: http://13.61.180.97/

What’s inside:
Dockerized frontend — ready to be containerized and deployed anywhere.

CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions — builds, pushes, and deploys automatically to AWS whenever code is pushed to the develop or main branch.

Structured and scalable setup — infrastructure-as-code (Terraform), deployment scripts, and secret handling for seamless delivery.
